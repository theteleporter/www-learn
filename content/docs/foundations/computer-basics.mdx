## Why It Matters

You can’t really *master* tech if you don’t know what’s happening under the hood.  
Understanding the fundamentals — from bits to CPUs — turns you from a “user” into a “builder.”  
This is where software meets silicon.

### Step 1 – What’s a Computer, Really?
Forget the buzzwords.  
A computer is just a machine that takes **input**, does **processing**, and spits out **output** — fast.  
Learn what makes that work: hardware, software, and logic.

### Step 2 – Binary & Logic
Underneath everything — it’s just **1s and 0s**.  
Learn how **binary**, **logic gates**, and **boolean algebra** form the foundation of computing.

### Step 3 – Hardware: The Real Stuff
Get familiar with **CPUs**, **memory**, and **storage** — the guts of your machine.  
Understand what happens between writing code and seeing results on screen.

### Step 4 – Software & Operating Systems
Software is what gives life to the hardware.  
Learn what **operating systems**, **file systems**, and **processes** actually do.  
You’ll start seeing computers less like “magic boxes” and more like layers of logic.

### Step 5 – Networking Basics
A single computer’s cool — a thousand talking together? That’s the internet.  
Learn the fundamentals of **IP**, **DNS**, and **protocols** so you can understand how the web really connects.

Computers aren’t magic — they’re just logic, math, and electricity working in sync.  
Understand how they think, and you’ll write cleaner code, design smarter systems, and debug with x-ray vision.  
Welcome to the core of computing.
