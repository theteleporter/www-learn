## Getting Started

Before you dive into frameworks or fancy tech, get your head right with the basics.  
This is where you learn to think, reason, and approach problems like an engineer – the good stuff that lasts forever.

### Step 1 – Learn to Think Logically
Start with **problem-solving** and **algorithmic thinking**.  
Figure out how to break things down, find patterns, and make your brain sweat a little.  
This is the root of all engineering.

### Step 2 – Brush Up on Math
You don’t need to love calculus, but you should respect it.  
Get comfortable with **algebra**, **probability**, and **geometry** – the kind of math that helps you reason about systems, data, and design.

### Step 3 – Get a Feel for Physics
Learn how motion, energy, and forces work – because the world doesn’t run on vibes alone.  
Start with **mechanics**, **thermodynamics**, and **electricity basics** to understand what makes real systems tick.

### Step 4 – Understand How Computers Think
Peek under the hood.  
Know what happens when you press “run” – **binary**, **memory**, **CPUs**, and how **software talks to hardware**.  
That knowledge makes everything else make sense.

### Step 5 – Build the Engineering Mindset
Engineering isn’t just about code or machines – it’s how you *think*.  
Learn **systems design**, **iteration**, and **debugging** as life skills.  
Don’t just learn things. Learn how to learn.
