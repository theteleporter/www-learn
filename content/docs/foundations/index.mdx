## Getting Started

The foundation is where you sharpen your brain before touching a single framework.  
Think of this as your warm-up lap — logic, math, and problem-solving that every great engineer builds on.

### Step 1 — Learn to Think Logically
Start with **problem-solving** and **algorithmic thinking**.  
Understand how to break problems into smaller chunks and reason through them like an engineer.

### Step 2 — Brush Up on Math
No need to be a math wizard, but know enough to model systems and reason about numbers.  
Focus on **applied math**, **linear algebra**, **probability**, and **basic calculus**.

### Step 3 — Get a Feel for Physics
Learn how motion, energy, and systems interact — it’s the stuff that powers real-world engineering.  
Start with **mechanics**, **thermodynamics**, and **electricity basics**.

### Step 4 — Understand How Computers Think
What happens when you press “run”?  
Learn about **binary**, **memory**, **CPUs**, and **how code becomes behavior**.

### Step 5 — Adopt the Engineering Mindset
Engineering isn’t just tools — it’s a way of thinking.  
Learn **systems design**, **iteration**, and how to **solve real problems** without overcomplicating them.
