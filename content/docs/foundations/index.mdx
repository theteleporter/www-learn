## Getting Started

Before diving into frameworks or fancy tech, nail the basics.  
This is where you learn to think, reason, and approach problems like an engineer – the good stuff that never expires.

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Step 1 – Learn to Think Logically
Start with **problem-solving** and **algorithmic thinking**.  
Break problems down, spot patterns, and get comfy reasoning step-by-step.  
That’s the root of all engineering.

### Step 2 – Brush Up on Math
You don’t need to love calculus, but you should respect it.  
Get solid with **algebra**, **probability**, and **geometry** – the kind of math that helps you reason about systems, data, and design.

### Step 3 – Get a Feel for Physics
The world doesn’t run on vibes alone.  
Learn how **motion**, **energy**, and **forces** interact, so you can connect digital logic with physical reality.

### Step 4 – Understand How Computers Think
Peek under the hood.  
Know what happens when you press “run” – **binary**, **memory**, **CPUs**, and how **software talks to hardware**.  
That context makes everything else click.

### Step 5 – Build the Engineering Mindset
Engineering isn’t just about code or machines – it’s how you *think*.  
Learn **systems design**, **iteration**, and **debugging** as life skills.  
Don’t just learn things. Learn how to learn.
