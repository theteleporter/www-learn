## Why Logic?

Logic is the cheat code for thinking clearly.  
Every line of code, circuit, or equation comes back to one thing — reasoning in small, precise steps.  
If you can’t think logically, the tech won’t save you.

## Step 1 – Understand the Basics

Start with what logic *is* — truth, falsehood, and everything in between.  
Grasp **propositions**, **operators** (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), and how to form valid arguments.  
These are the building blocks of programming, circuits, and even debates with your friends.

## Step 2 – Dive Into Boolean Logic

This is where it gets real.  
Learn how **true/false** statements power computers.  
Study **truth tables**, **De Morgan’s laws**, and **logical equivalence** — you’ll start seeing the binary world everywhere.

## Step 3 – Apply Logic Everywhere

Now link logic to code, design, and systems.  
When you debug, optimize, or even write conditionals, you’re doing applied logic.  
Thinking clearly *is* engineering.

**Practice:**  
- [Logic.ly – Interactive Logic Gate Simulator](https://logic.ly/demo/)  
- [Truth Table Generator](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/tools/truth-table-tool/)  
- Try implementing simple logic puzzles or writing small conditional programs.
