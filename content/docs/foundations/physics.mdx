## Why Physics Matters

Physics turns math into motion.  
It’s how your code controls a motor, how a drone stays in the air, or why your circuit overheats at 3 AM.  
If math is the theory — physics is the proof.

### Step 1 – Mechanics: How Things Move
Start with **motion**, **forces**, and **energy** — the OGs of physics.  
Learn how to describe velocity, acceleration, and Newton’s laws.  
This gives you intuition for anything that moves — robots, cars, simulations, you name it.

### Step 2 – Thermodynamics: Heat, Energy, Chaos
Why does your laptop turn into a toaster during render time?  
Thermo explains that.  
Learn about **energy transfer**, **entropy**, and **efficiency** — the principles behind engines, CPUs, and climate systems.

### Step 3 – Electricity & Magnetism
This is where physics meets electrons.  
Understand **current**, **voltage**, and **fields**, and how they power every circuit, motor, and signal system on Earth.

### Step 4 – Waves, Light & Signals
Sound, light, and data all travel as waves — different mediums, same math.  
Learn how **frequency**, **amplitude**, and **phase** shape everything from radio signals to quantum computing.

### Step 5 – Modern Physics: The Wild Stuff
Once you’ve got the classics down, peek into the weird side — **quantum**, **relativity**, and **particle physics**.  
Even if you’re not building rockets, it’ll expand how you think about systems and limits.

Physics is your bridge between theory and hardware — between code and atoms.  
You don’t just *learn* it, you *use* it: every servo, simulation, and circuit relies on these ideas.  
Understand the world, and you can engineer it better.
