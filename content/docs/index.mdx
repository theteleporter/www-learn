WWW-LEARN is an open-source collection of **engineering and computer science resources** – built by the community, for the community.

Whether you're just starting out or leveling up your skills, this guide helps you **find the best learning paths, tools, and principles** to grow as an engineer. No fluff, no gatekeeping – just solid knowledge from around the web.

## What is WWW-LEARN?

Think of it as your **engineering map of the internet** – covering everything from programming and software design to system architecture, AI, cloud, and even aerospace engineering 🚀.

Each section is curated, categorized, and open for anyone to improve.  
You can:
- Explore beginner-friendly roadmaps   
- Discover high-quality courses, docs, and tutorials   
- Contribute new resources through GitHub PRs   

## Why it exists

Because finding *where to start* shouldn’t be harder than learning itself.  
We’ve all been there – lost between a thousand tabs, conflicting opinions, and “10-minute tutorials.”  
WWW-LEARN was made to fix that.

## Join the mission

Share what helped *you*, learn from others, and help the next generation of builders, coders, and dreamers.  
Let’s make learning engineering **open, accessible, and actually fun**.



Made with ❤️ by engineers who’ve been in the trenches.
