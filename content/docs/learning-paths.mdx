You’ve got your bearings – now it’s time to pick a lane.

These paths aren’t meant to box you in. They’re here to give you direction. Each one lays out the concepts and principles that take you from beginner to builder.  
Follow one, mix a few, or wander between them. The only rule: keep learning.

## Foundations

The bedrock of every field. Logic, problem-solving, math, and physics concepts that make everything else possible. Start here to understand how systems work, think critically, and approach problems like an engineer.

What you’ll explore:
- Logic and problem-solving  
- Applied mathematics  
- Physics and mechanics  
- Systems thinking and control theory  

## Computing & Software

Where ideas become code. Learn how to design systems, write clean software, and understand how computers really work.

Paths under this pillar:
- Software Engineering – algorithms, data structures, OOP, design patterns  
- Frontend & UI/UX – interfaces, accessibility, design systems, usability  
- Backend & Systems – APIs, databases, scalability, architecture  
- DevOps & Cloud – CI/CD, containers, infrastructure, automation  
- Cybersecurity – network security, encryption, ethical hacking  
- AI & Data Science – ML, neural networks, data analysis, visualization  
- Data Engineering – pipelines, big data, ETL, cloud storage

## Hardware & Physical Engineering

For when you want to make ideas exist in the real world. From microcontrollers to rockets, this is where code meets atoms.

Paths under this pillar:
- Embedded Systems & IoT – sensors, microcontrollers, firmware  
- Electrical & Electronics – circuit design, PCB layout, signal processing  
- Robotics & Automation – control systems, motion planning, ROS  
- Aerospace & Mechanical – thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, simulation  

## Design & Creative Engineering

Bridging art and engineering. Learn how to design experiences, products, and systems that look good and work better.

Paths under this pillar:
- Industrial Design – form, ergonomics, materials, physical prototyping  
- Product Design – usability, design thinking, rapid iteration  
- UI/UX Design – interface principles, accessibility, interaction  
- Human-Computer Interaction – research, prototyping, and evaluation  

## Cyber & Infrastructure

The unseen layer that keeps everything connected, secure, and running smoothly.

Paths under this pillar:
- Network Engineering – protocols, routing, server administration  
- Systems Engineering – OS concepts, virtualization, performance tuning  
- Cloud Architecture – distributed systems, infrastructure as code, scaling  
- Security Engineering – cryptography, audits, threat modeling  

Each pillar links to deeper pages with curated roadmaps, resources, and project ideas.  
Explore what catches your interest, follow your curiosity, and keep building.
