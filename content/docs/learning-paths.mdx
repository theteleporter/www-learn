You’ve got your bearings — now it’s time to pick a lane.

These paths aren’t meant to box you in. They’re here to give you direction. Each one lays out the concepts, tools, and principles that take you from beginner to builder.  
Follow one, mix a few, or wander between them. The only rule: keep learning.
