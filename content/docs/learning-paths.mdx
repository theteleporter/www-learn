# Learning Paths

You’ve got your bearings. Now it’s time to pick a lane.

These paths aren’t meant to box you in — they’re here to give you direction. Each one is packed with the key topics, tools, and ideas that’ll take you from beginner to builder.  
You can follow one, or bounce between a few. The goal is to keep learning, not to rush it.

---

## Software Engineering

Learn how to think like an engineer, design clean systems, and write code that actually scales.  
This is the core of everything else — logic, problem-solving, and architecture.

**What you’ll cover**
- Programming fundamentals  
- Algorithms and data structures  
- Object-oriented design  
- Version control (Git)  
- Clean code and design patterns  

**Languages**  
Python, JavaScript, C, Go  

**Frameworks / Tools**  
React, Express, Django, VS Code

---

## Frontend & UI/UX

Where creativity meets logic. You’ll be crafting interfaces that people actually enjoy using.  
It’s not just about making things look nice — it’s about usability, accessibility, and performance.

**What you’ll cover**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Responsive design and accessibility  
- UI/UX fundamentals  
- State management and component-driven design  

**Frameworks / Tools**  
React, Vue, Svelte, Figma, Tailwind CSS

---

## Backend & Systems

The engine behind the web. Learn how data moves, how APIs talk, and how servers stay alive under load.

**What you’ll cover**
- Databases (SQL & NoSQL)  
- APIs and REST principles  
- Authentication and security  
- Scalability and caching  
- Deployment and CI/CD  

**Languages / Tools**  
Node.js, Go, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx

---

## Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering

For those who look up and think, “yeah, I can build that.”  
A mix of physics, control systems, and software — the stuff that makes rockets, drones, and machines come alive.

**What you’ll cover**
- Mechanics, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics  
- Control systems and simulation  
- Embedded systems and microcontrollers  
- CAD modeling and design thinking  

**Tools**  
MATLAB, Python, Simulink, SolidWorks, Arduino

---

## AI & Data Science

The math-powered side of engineering. You’ll teach machines to learn, reason, and make predictions — or at least try to.

**What you’ll cover**
- Statistics and probability  
- Machine learning concepts  
- Neural networks and deep learning  
- Data visualization and analysis  

**Languages / Tools**  
Python, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jupyter
