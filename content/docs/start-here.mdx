## Where to Begin

Alright, so you wanna dive into the wild world of engineering, coding, or design. Don’t stress – everyone starts somewhere.  
Think of this as your map. Here’s a quick overview of the main pillars in WWW-LEARN − each one points to a set of curated resources, guides, and roadmaps. You pick a lane, or bounce between a few. No rush, no pressure, just start exploring.

### Foundations

The basics that make everything else click. Logic, math, physics, and general engineering principles. Get these down and the rest becomes way easier.

- Logic and problem-solving  
- Applied mathematics  
- Physics and mechanics  
- Systems thinking and control theory  

### Computing & Software

All the stuff where you turn ideas into code. Frontend, backend, DevOps, AI, cybersecurity − pick what grabs you.

- Software Engineering  
- Frontend & UI/UX  
- Backend & Systems  
- DevOps & Cloud  
- Cybersecurity  
- AI & Data Science  
- Data Engineering  

### Hardware & Physical Engineering

When you’re ready to make things real – microcontrollers, robots, drones, rockets. This is where atoms meet code.

- Embedded Systems & IoT  
- Electrical & Electronics  
- Robotics & Automation  
- Aerospace & Mechanical  

### Design & Creative Engineering

Learn how to make stuff look and feel good while still working well. Design thinking, product design, UI/UX − the creative side of engineering.

- Industrial Design  
- Product Design  
- UI/UX Design  
- Human-Computer Interaction  

### Cyber & Infrastructure

The invisible systems keeping modern tech running. Networks, cloud, system management, and security − the backbone of it all.

- Network Engineering  
- Systems Engineering  
- Cloud Architecture  
- Security Engineering
