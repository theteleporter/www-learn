So you’ve decided to dive into engineering, tech, or coding – nice move 😏.  
Now the question hits: *where the heck do I even begin?*

Relax. We’ve got you.

Below is a simple path to help you start from zero, figure out your interests, and build real projects along the way.  
No "learn everything in 30 days" nonsense – just a steady, realistic progression.


## 1. Build your foundation

Before picking languages or frameworks, understand **how computers and the web actually work.**  
- How the internet connects things   
- What code does under the hood   
- Basics of data, logic, and problem-solving 💭  

Resources: 
- [CS50x by Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)  
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)  

## 2. Pick a lane, but stay curious

Start with one **main area**:
- **Frontend** (web design, interfaces)
- **Backend** (servers, databases)
- **Embedded** (hardware + software)
- **Data/AI** (statistics, ML, analytics)
- **Engineering Principles** (math, physics, systems)

Try stuff. Break stuff. Figure out what *clicks* for you.

## 3. Learn by building

Tutorials are cool – but projects make it *stick*.  
Start with small things you care about:
- A portfolio site  
- A calculator  
- A mini-game  
- A REST API  
- A circuit blinking an LED  

Doesn’t matter how simple it is. Just ship it.

## 4. Get involved

Join a community, contribute to open source, or help someone else debug.  
That’s where the real growth happens.

Places to hang out:
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to)
- [Reddit r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming)
- Discord servers (like *The Odin Project*, *FreeCodeCamp*, etc.)

## 5. Keep iterating

Learning engineering isn’t linear. You’ll circle back, forget things, relearn them better – that’s normal.

Just keep moving forward. The path is yours to design.
